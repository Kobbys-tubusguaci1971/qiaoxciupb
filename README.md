Just stumbled out of the theater after watching Thudarum, and my brain feels like a blender on high speed with the lid off. Seriously, what did I just watch? I mean, the plot had more twists than a pretzel factory. One moment I'm gripped, biting off my nails, and the next I'm rolling my eyes wondering why a guy who just survived a car crash is running at the speed of light like he's in some superhero film. But that's cinema for ya.

It's a bit like what would happen if you microwave a leftover emotional casserole from last night—things heat up, you think you’ve figured it out, and then bam, something else explodes and you're wiping spaghetti off the microwave door. The characters, oh boy. Some were so life-like I almost felt like they’d step off the screen and ask for a selfie with me, while others... I swear they were cardboard cutouts pretending to be human. You know that dreadful feeling when the dialogue sounds like it was written by a robot trying to find the meaning of love for the first time? Yeah, had that too.

> And don’t even get me started on the ending. Felt like being left on a bizarre cliffhanger, like someone left you asking where the edge of the cliff really was—did I jump? Or am I still standing on the unstable ground waiting for a sequel or a refund for that emotional investment?

Also, shoutout to the soundtrack. Whoever mashed up those tunes deserves an award for making me feel both nostalgic and oddly irritated at once. Like when you hear a song you loved ten years ago, only to realize you have no idea why you loved it in the first place. 

Look, despite it all, it’s a movie I’d probably tell a friend to download and watch, just to see their reactions. I’m curious to know if they’ll find the hidden gem moments or just ask me why I recommend these things to them. Some scenes had the aesthetic appeal of a beautifully chaotic painting—the kind that makes you feel both bewildered and comforted, like a dream you half-remember. 

```python
def experience_movie(thudarum):
    while thudarum.still_showing():
        audience.react(bewildered=True)
```

All in all, guess I’m glad I saw it, if only to have something to irrationally rant about over coffee tomorrow. Who knows, maybe the next time I walk into a theater I should bring popcorn and leave my expectations at home. Until next time, cinema.
